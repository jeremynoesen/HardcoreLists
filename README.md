# HardcoreLists
A player listing system for hardcore Spigot Minecraft servers 

HardcoreLists will generate lists of players based on alive or dead status, pvp cooldown times, as well as a list of all players who have played the hardcore server. This plugin also adds a simple pvp cool-down after joining that disappears after a custom set time. use `/hardcorelists help` to see all commands.

This plugin was never meant for public release, so the documentation is incomplete.

## Notice
This project was abandoned, and will most likely not be completed.
