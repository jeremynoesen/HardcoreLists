# HardcoreLists

A player listing system for hardcore Spigot Minecraft servers 

HardcoreLists will generate lists of players based on alive or dead status, pvp cooldown times, as well as a list of all players who have played the hardcore server. This plugin also adds a simple pvp cool-down after joining that disappears after a custom set time.
